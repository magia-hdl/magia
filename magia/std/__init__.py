Commonly used design blocks

Consider putting a design blocks here if:
- It is a commonly used design block, but not a full IP
- It can be described as a function that returns a signal
- It has less generality than a generator, with a limited number of parameters

e.g. Counter, FIFO, Fixed-Point Conversions, etc.
